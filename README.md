Lunchfinder is a simple application that helps you choose quickly a restaurant to eat around your location.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
yarn start
```

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mdcarter/lunchfinder.io
cd lunchfinder.io/
yarn
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
yarn build
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
yarn deploy
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Configuration

using the project.

## Tests

Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
yarn test
